TOTAL: 43/45

Reproducibility â€“ another person should be able to run your code, and understand how it works [10/10 points]
* Detailed readme file (see above) [4/4 points]
* Jupyter notebook contains all necessary sections (see above) [4/4 points]
* Git repository is organized and does not contain unnecessary files [2/2 points]

Depth of scientific analysis [9/10 points]
* Raw data plotted to show variability in space and/or time [1/1 points]
* Visual comparisons show relationships between different variables [2/2 points]
* Calculations go beyond raw data (examples: quality control, subsets of data created, variables combined in model calculations) [3/4 points]
* Appropriate statistical analysis performed to address hypotheses (note: credit given for identifying correct approach, not statistical significance) [2/3 points]
  
Try to use more decriptive variable names in the analysis (xp,fp,yinterp are used in generic examples but are not the best names for this specific analysis, and will make harder to remember what you did later).
  
Be sure to adjust p values for effective degrees of freedom if interoplating data to a finer grid. The interpolation step is really only necessary if you are comparing two different cores to each other and they have been sampled at different depths.
  
Presentation: Professional delivery, uses effective graphics, and does not use unnecessary text. [5/5 points]
Demonstration that the topic is important (i.e. something that others will care about) [5/5 points]
Completeness of description of the scientific question being investigated [5/5 points]
Clarity of writing, logical progression of ideas [5/5 points]
    
Proper citation of outside references from peer-reviewed literature [5/5 points]

Clarity and relevance of information presented in figures [5/5 points]

Comments:

* Good job on challenging the assumptions of the correlation analysis, and not just accepting a low p-value.
* It is interesting that the two cores that are closest to each other are actually pretty different (at least to a non-geologist).
