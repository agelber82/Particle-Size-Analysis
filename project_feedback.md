7/10

Readme file – 2/4
There is a readme file, but it does not describe: steps needed to run the code on another computer, dependencies, location of data in repository, or how to access data.

There is an old notebook file which runs, but there is no written information about what has been done.

Git repo – 2/2

Well organized. Some files unnecessary for project. 

Comments:

Be sure to focus on interpretation and writing for final version, in addition to analysis.
