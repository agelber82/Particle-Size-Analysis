The depostional records of the ocean floor contains a history of paleo oceanographic records waiting to be disovered and analyzed. 
From core samples from the western pacific warm pool, a depostional history can be retrieved. By analzying size grain through time, 
we can construct past environmental conditions to an extent. My focus is on comparing size grains with depth under the sea bottom floor. 
The data for the grain sizes was collected using an LPS in Ivano's lab. As of now, we have 3 sites that can be analyzed using mean, 
median, mode sizes and standard deviations.

In this preliminary analysis, I plotted the mean size particle with respect to depth below the sea level floor. All the depth measurements
are top depth levels down from the sea floor bottom.  

I have 2 other cores two import and I will do a similar analysis.
